## Canonical Application Statuses

Use exactly these values — no variations:
`Evaluated` | `Applied` | `Followed Up` | `Responded` | `Interview` | `Offer` | `Rejected` | `Discarded` | `SKIP`

---

## TSV Tracker Format

10 columns, tab-separated, saved to `data/applications.md`:
```
Date\tCompany\tRole\tURL\tScore\tStatus\tResume\tCover\tNotes\tFollowUp
```

- **Date**: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Score**: 0.0–10.0 (weighted composite)
- **Status**: one of the canonical statuses above
- **Resume**: ✅ if tailored resume generated, ❌ if not
- **Cover**: ✅ if cover letter generated, ❌ if not
- **FollowUp**: ISO date of next recommended follow-up, or blank

---

## Report File Naming Convention

`reports/{###}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

Examples:
- `reports/001-crowdstrike-2026-04-05.md`
- `reports/002-aws-soc-2026-04-06.md`

Number is zero-padded to 3 digits. Check the reports/ directory to find the next number.

---

## Pipeline.md Format

`data/pipeline.md` holds URLs pending evaluation — one per line, optionally annotated:
```
https://example.com/jobs/123  # seen on LinkedIn, looks strong
https://example.com/jobs/456
```

---

## Playwright Usage Rules

- Use Playwright (not WebSearch) to verify job postings are still active
- If a page 404s or shows "This job is no longer available", log `SKIP` and notify user
- Use WebSearch for company research (news, culture, hiring signals)
- Never scrape personal data

---

## Tone Guidelines

- Direct and confident — Brian is transitioning into a technical career with real experience
- No hedging ("you might want to consider possibly...")
- No filler ("Great question!")
- Acknowledge gaps honestly and frame them as closing fast
- Match cover letter tone to company culture (startup: casual + bold; enterprise: formal + precise)
