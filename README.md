## 12-Dimension Scoring System

Every job is scored as a weighted composite (0–10):

| # | Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Role match | 12% | JD title alignment with target roles |
| 2 | Tech stack | 12% | AWS, Azure, KQL, Sentinel, AD, honeynet overlap |
| 3 | ATS keyword match | 10% | JD keywords present in your resume |
| 4 | Cert alignment | 10% | Required/preferred certs vs. your tier profile |
| 5 | Compensation fit | 10% | Comp vs. your minimum (from profile.yml) |
| 6 | Growth trajectory | 8% | Will this role accelerate your path? |
| 7 | Culture/mission | 8% | Company mission alignment |
| 8 | Location/remote | 8% | Remote-friendly or target city match |
| 9 | Portfolio relevance | 8% | GitHub proof points matching the JD |
| 10 | Interview probability | 6% | Likelihood of passing ATS + screen |
| 11 | Urgency | 4% | Expiring posting, hot company |
| 12 | Network/referral | 4% | Warm connection or community overlap |

**Score tiers:**

| Score | Tier | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 8.0+ | Apply Now | Tailored resume + cover letter today |
| 6.0–7.9 | Apply/Tailor | Polish resume, generate cover letter |
| 4.0–5.9 | Low Priority | Apply only if the week is slow |
| < 4.0 | Skip | Log and move on |

---

## Cert Tier Profile

The scoring engine uses a tiered cert profile to assess alignment and prioritize study:

**Tier 1 — In Progress:** AWS CLF-C02 · CompTIA CySA+
**Tier 2 — Next:** AWS SAA-C03 · Security+ · AZ-500
**Tier 3 — Long-term:** AWS SAP-C02 · CISSP · CCSP

Run `/certs` to see which certs appear most in your active applications.

## Philosophy

**Quality over quantity.**

Push Job is designed to produce 3–5 strong, tailored applications per week — not 50
spray-and-pray submissions. Every application has a researched cover letter, a keyword-optimized
resume, and a clear reason to apply.

The agent prepares. You review. You submit.
