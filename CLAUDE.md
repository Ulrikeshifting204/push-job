## First-Run Onboarding

At the start of **every session**, silently check for these files:
- `resume.md`
- `config/profile.yml`
- `portals.yml`

If **any are missing**, immediately enter onboarding mode and follow these steps in order:

### Step 1 — Resume
> "I don't see your resume yet. Paste your current resume content (any format) and I'll structure it into resume.md."
Save as `resume.md` using the template structure from `examples/resume.example.md`.

### Step 2 — Profile
> "Let me set up your job search profile. I'll ask a few quick questions:"
- Target roles (primary / secondary)
- Target locations + remote preference
- Minimum salary
- Preferred company sizes
- Industries to avoid
- Certifications in progress / planned
Save as `config/profile.yml` (use `config/profile.example.yml` as the schema).

### Step 3 — GitHub Portfolio Sync
> "Do you have GitHub projects you want me to reference when evaluating jobs and writing cover letters?"
If yes, invoke `modes/portfolio-sync.md` and save `portfolio.md`.
If no, save a stub: `portfolio.md` with placeholder sections.

### Step 4 — Portals
> "Copy `templates/portals.example.yml` to `portals.yml`. Remove companies you'd never apply to and add any others."
Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 5 — Tracker Init
> Check if `data/applications.md` exists. If not, create it with the TSV header row.
Confirm: "Pipeline initialized. You're ready. Try `/evaluate [URL]` to score your first job."

## Mode Routing Table

| User says…                                | Route to                          |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

| `/resume [URL or company]`                | `modes/resume-mode.md`            |
| `/scan`                                   | `modes/scan.md`                   |

| `/certs`                                  | `modes/certs.md`                  |
| `/followup`                               | `modes/followup.md`               |
| `/brief`                                  | `modes/brief.md`                  |
| `/negotiate [offer amount]`               | `modes/negotiate.md`              |
| `/outreach [company or person]`           | `modes/outreach.md`               |
| `/portfolio-sync`                         | `modes/portfolio-sync.md`         |
| `/check` or `/health`                     | Run `scripts/pipeline-check.mjs`  |
| `/help`                                   | Print this routing table          |

When a mode is invoked, read the corresponding file in `modes/` and follow its instructions exactly.
Always read `modes/_shared.md` first for archetypes, cert tiers, and shared context.

## 12-Dimension Scoring System

Score every job on a scale of 0–10 per dimension. Final score = weighted average.

| # | Dimension              | Weight | What to measure                                                      |
|---|------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Role match             | 12%    | Does the title + JD match Brian's target roles?                      |
| 2 | Tech stack alignment   | 12%    | Overlap with AWS, Azure, KQL, Sentinel, AD, honeynet skills          |
| 3 | ATS keyword match      | 10%    | Keywords in JD that appear in resume.md                              |
| 4 | Cert alignment         | 10%    | Does the JD require/prefer certs Brian has or is pursuing?           |
| 5 | Compensation fit       | 10%    | Does comp (stated or estimated) meet Brian's minimum?                |
| 6 | Growth trajectory      |  8%    | Will this role accelerate Brian's path to senior cloud/cyber?        |
| 7 | Culture/mission        |  8%    | Company mission alignment, team culture signals                      |
| 8 | Location/remote        |  8%    | Remote-friendly or Charlotte, NC proximity?                          |
| 9 | Portfolio relevance    |  8%    | Does portfolio.md contain proof points for this JD?                  |
|10 | Interview probability  |  6%    | Likelihood of clearing ATS + hiring manager screen                   |
|11 | Urgency                |  4%    | Time-sensitive opportunity (expiring soon, hot company)?             |
|12 | Network/referral       |  4%    | Is there a connection, warm lead, or community overlap?              |

### Score Tiers

| Score    | Tier       | Action                                           |
|----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 8.0–10.0 | Apply Now  | Tailored resume + cover letter today             |
| 6.0–7.9  | Apply/Tailor | Polish resume, generate cover letter            |
| 4.0–5.9  | Low Priority | Keep in pipeline, apply only if week is slow   |
| < 4.0    | Skip       | Log as SKIP in tracker, move on                  |

## Cert Alignment Logic

Cross-reference JD cert requirements against Brian's cert tier profile:

### Brian's Cert Tiers

**Tier 1 — In Progress (weight these highest)**
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)
- CompTIA CySA+

**Tier 2 — Next 6–12 Months**
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)
- CompTIA Security+
- Microsoft AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer)

**Tier 3 — Long-Term**
- AWS Solutions Architect Professional (SAP-C02)
- CISSP
- CCSP (Cloud Security Alliance)

### Scoring Logic
- Job requires Tier 1 cert Brian is pursuing → cert_alignment += 2 points (strong signal)
- Job requires Tier 2 cert → cert_alignment += 1 point (motivating gap)
- Job requires Tier 3 cert as hard requirement → cert_alignment -= 1 point (barrier)
- Job mentions "CLF-C02 preferred" or "studying for CySA+" eligible → full credit

## Follow-Up Scheduler Rules

Read `data/followups.md` and `data/applications.md` daily during `/brief` and `/followup`.

| Days since application | Status         | Action                                      |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 7 days                 | Follow Up Due  | Draft polite follow-up email                |
| 14+ days               | Cold           | Send final follow-up, then mark Discarded if no response |
| Responded              | Clear timer    | Reset; wait for next action signal          |

Follow-up email rules:
- Max 3 sentences
- Reference application date and role title
- Do not grovel; project confidence
- Never send without user review

## Daily Brief Format (`/brief`)

```
=== PUSH JOB DAILY BRIEF — [DATE] ===

PIPELINE SNAPSHOT
  Total tracked: X
  Applied: X | Interviewing: X | Offers: X | Rejected: X

FOLLOW-UPS
  Due today: X (list names)
  Overdue (14+ days): X (list names)

  CySA+:   [progress note from profile.yml]

TODAY'S RECOMMENDED ACTION
  [One specific, actionable thing Brian should do today]
===
```

---

## Pipeline Integrity Rules

### TSV Format (10 columns, tab-separated)
```
Date  Company  Role  URL  Score  Status  Resume  Cover  Notes  FollowUp
```

### Tracker Merge Flow
1. Evaluations write TSV rows to `batch/tracker-additions/`
2. Run `npm run merge` to dedup and append to `data/applications.md`
3. Never write directly to `data/applications.md` mid-session without user confirmation

### Canonical Statuses
`Evaluated` | `Applied` | `Followed Up` | `Responded` | `Interview` | `Offer` | `Rejected` | `Discarded` | `SKIP`

### NEVER Submit Without Review
Before any application action, always surface:
> "Here is what I've prepared. **Review everything before you submit.** I'll never click Apply for you."

---

## Ethical Use

Push Job is a **quality-over-quantity** system. The goal is 3–5 strong, tailored applications
per week — not 50 spray-and-pray submissions.

Rules:
1. Never generate applications for roles Brian clearly isn't qualified for
2. Never fabricate experience, projects, or skills
3. Always stop before hitting Submit — user reviews and submits manually
4. Flag if a company appears on portals.yml with `skip: true`
5. Be honest about gaps. "You're missing X — here's how to address it" is more helpful than padding

---

## Personalization

Brian can ask Claude to:
- Edit resume.md, portfolio.md, or config/profile.yml at any time
- Add, remove, or update companies in portals.yml
- Change scoring weights in config/scoring.yml
- Customize cover letter tone for specific company cultures
- Add STAR stories to interview-prep/story-bank.md

To update a file: "Update [file] to [change]" and Claude will read the current content first,
then make the targeted edit.
